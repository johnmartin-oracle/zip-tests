zip-tests
=========

Test suite for Zip (Info-Zip). I will be glad if you add your hands and write some suggestions, tips or tests.

It's created for testing of new upstream versions (only beta now, avalable on ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/beta/). I think that tests could be helpfull for next development for upstream and also zip maintainers.

Using
=====
You can change path to your zip in top of the script or create directory in zip source code and copy script there. In directory with the script is required  Write permission for creating of files for testing.

Notes
=====
Colored output - Yes, it's not ideal for every output. It can be removed or will be added commandline option for colored output. For me is good now.
